# Lecture

## Any Issues with git so far?

## Live Demonstration

-   Initializing a git Project in Rstudio

-   Using git in Rstudio

-   Using GitHub

## Terminology

-   **Init**ialize a repository, before you can use git in there
-   **Add** the files you want to stage for commit
-   Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history by **commit**ing it
-   You can see the history of your commits, the **log**

# Practical

## 1: Initializing git ✨

For this whole exercise sheet we will be tracking all our changes to it in git.

a)  Start by initializing a new R project with git support, called `practical-5`. If you forgot how to do this, you can follow this [guide](https://malikaihle.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/rstudio_project.html).
b)  Commit the files generated by Rstudio.
c)  For all of the following tasks in this exercise sheet we ask you to always commit your changes after finishing each subtask e.g. create a commit after task *1d*, *1e* etc.
d)  Create a new Rmarkdown file, which we will be working in now. Commit the empty file in git.

## 2: Guessing Game 🎯

a)  Answer the following guessing questions, each in its own line:
    1)  How many liters of Beer have been drunken at the Oktoberfest in Munich in 2019? 🍻
    2000 l
    2)  How many people live in Karlsruhe? (Exactly) 🏘️
    563237
    3)  What percentage of Americans asked in a survey in 2017, indicated that they believe in Astrology? 🌟
    62%
b)  Commit your guess.
c)  Look at the solution below and replace your guesses with the correct solution. Look at the changes in the git view.

<details>

<summary>Solution</summary>

```         
Question A 🍻 Liters of beer [^1]
7,850,200
Question B 🏘️ People in Karlsruhe
313,092
Question C 🌟 % believing in Astrology [^2]
29%
```

</details>

d)  Knit this exercise sheet. Some new files will automatically be generated when knitting the sheet e.g. the HTML page. Ignore these files, as we only want to track the source files themselves.

## 3: Putting your Repository on GitHub 🌐

a)  Create a new repository on GitHub in your account named `practical-4`. Make sure you create a **public repository** so we others can see it. Add the link to the repository below:

...

b)  Push your code to this new repository by copying and executing the snippet on github listed under `…or push an existing repository from the command line`.
c)  Regularly push your latest changes to GitHub again and especially do so when you are finished with this sheet.
